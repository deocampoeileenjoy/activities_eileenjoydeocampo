       Did the GIT is useful to the programmers and developers? yes/no: and why?     
     ans:Yes, GIT is useful to the programmers and developers because Git is the most commonly used version control system. Git tracks the changes you make to files, so you have a record of what has been done, and you can revert to specific versions should you ever need to. Git also makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one source.Git offers the type of performance, functionality, security, and flexibility that most developers and teams need to develop their projects.
