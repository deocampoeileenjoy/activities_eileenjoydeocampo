Common Advantages and Disadvantages of Multithreading in Java.We are heading towards the critical shortage of time where multitasking
 has become synonymous with efficiency. Similarly, in the programming world also, a program performing a single task is not sufficient 
and good enough. An efficient program is the one that lets you execute multiple tasks using the same program. Such an efficient program 
can be created using the Java programming language since Java is a multithreaded programming language. Also, Java is the first programming 
language that introduced the concept of multithreading.

Multithreading in Java.The primary function of multithreading is to simultaneously run or execute multiple tasks. These tasks are represented 
as threads in a Java program and have a separate execution path. Also, handling of multithreaded Java programs is easy because you can decide 
the sequence in which execution of Java threads take place.Some of the common advantages of multithreading:Enhanced performance by decreased 
development time,simplified and streamlined program coding,improvised GUI responsiveness, simultaneous and parallelized occurrence of tasks,
better use of cache storage by utilization of resources,decreased cost of maintenance,better use of CPU resource.Multithreading does not only
 provide you with benefits, it has its disadvantages too. Let us go through some common disadvantages:complex debugging and testing processes,
overhead switching of context,increased potential for deadlock occurrence,increased difficulty level in writing a program, and unpredictable results.
